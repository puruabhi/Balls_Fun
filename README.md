# Balls Fun

Balls Fun is a game about moving balls in which there is a blue ball for user 
which they can willingly control and move on screen. There are several 
red balls moving on screen in random direction. When game starts, user's blue ball will 
be at the center of screen and red balls on corners of the screen. Red balls will 
start moving when user touches the screen. Red balls will collide and reflect from walls 
(edges of screen). Speed of balls will increase every 5 seconds from beginning.
